1373,,,,,,,never heard of pdisks... i'll google it
1374,,,,,,,we've had issues in the past where daemon.log on the nodes was getting huge and not rotated fast enough
1375,,,,,,,"the service itself expects websocket connections on /ws, but I've tried everything I can think of to tell k8s Ingress to just pass that through and to have the websocket annotation on that service. A more complete end-to-end example would be really helpful I think."
1376,,,,,,,"Hi! We have an issue that a container stops responding on network (mostly http) requests with a connection reset by peer, shown on traefik logs. If I try that request inside container it works perfect, but not from another container or from any node. I've reviewed base node image with up-to-date network/provider drivers (aws with ixgbevf and ena), updated cluster (up to 1.7.5, same stable version from kops) and traefik up-to-date (as loadb level7). The metrics shows a flat chart on cpu and mem while they do not respond. Killing the unresponsive pod obviously makes it work again. Usually it responds again after some minutes. It seems to happens to most of hpa or frontend containers. Any thoughts? Thanks."
1377,,,,,,,I seem to be having trouble getting my route53 domain configuration to update after using kops to create a new cluster. Due to this I get timeout issues; my version is 1.7.0.. it does update two of the 4 dns records correctly but the api and api.internal are forgotten it seems.

1384,,,,,,,@hubt i fully understood what you said about dividing up a cluster into namespaces .. I'm still unsure when I have to pass a --context flag and what value it should be
1385,,,,,,,You could try adding Host header to your logs to debug
1386,,,,,,,welcome
1387,,,,,,,"Right. kops defaulted at one point to putting the Service IPs in 100.64.0.0/16, which is in the reserved range for carrier-grade NAT, which will almost certainly not be routable in your network."

1412,,,,,,,@pep no prob. @mikej u mean defining the pv directly on the template (specifying the volume id)?
1413,,,,,,,@boblafleur pod anti-affinity
1414,,,,,,,I have created a statefulset and some other k8s objects with a yaml file. The pods that are supposed to be created from the replica within the statefulset never come to life. Neither does the statefulset as you can see it already exists but apparently it doesn't exist either as it can't be found.

1421,,,,,,,expose this with a service using NodePort / LoadBalancer.... or Ingress otherwise
1422,,,,,,,The kubenet plugin ran out of IPs on one of my nodes. It seems IPs are not being GCed when there's a restart or a container dies. Does anyone else have this problem?

1428,,,,,,,Use 'kubectl describe pod/reverse-proxy-prod-nginx-ingress-controller-2327356158-k8srn' to see all of the containers in this pod.
1429,,,,,,,yes. you have to use a node ip.
1430,,,,,,,you should probably be using a Job instead of a Deployment then
1431,,,,,,,"How would I create a PSP that is referenced by default? I'm essentially trying to get my customers on their own namespaces. But the PSPs would span the cluster. I don't want them to have any cluster admin stuff, just within their namespace. Do I create a ClusterRole and a namespaced-RoleBinding? Does the customer need to create their own RoleBindings? Is there a way that a specific PSP is applied without being called as a default?"

1451,,,,,,,"@jeffhub thanks, seems like moving to ingress might be the thing."
1452,,,,,,,"again, export the yaml file.. and then delete it.."
1453,,,,,,,@jeffhub thanks. Is there any way to speed up that ? Or use another method of exposing resources to outside world ?

If you aren't happy and want to use the older version, the old lein template is still around. Just use lein new exponent <project-name> to get it."

1848,,,,,,,what happens when you run adb devices?
1849,,,,,,,"hi guys, I'm a little bit worried, how expo is making money? I'm worried of using a [great] tool that could cease to exist at any day"

1851,,,,,,,do you really need to use absolute?
1852,,,,,,,Thanks @peter. Is there a reference to version of React to use for each version of expo sdk?
1853,,,,,,,"@adamjnav Not at all man.. I am probably coming out as the annoying person who asks too much and you guys have to deal with my issues, and I highly appreciate that.. hopefully I will be able to help back as well in the future.. I'm trying to implement the exponent push notification server using node.. so the first thing I have to do is yarn add exponent-server-sdk... and when I do that I get No lockfile found.. TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null."
1854,,,,,,,"hey @info so from the logs i can see with your request id, when fetching push certs, it fails with 'Could not find app with bundle id'. Can you check that the bundle id on your push certificate (you can verify this on the apple developer website) matches the bundle id that you have in app.json?"
1855,,,,,,,$(SRCROOT)/../../../ios/Pods/Headers/Public/
1856,,,,,,,Hey @ccheever one last query Can I use back-end only as node server or php serve will serve good as well?
1857,,,,,,,actually we're completely removing the button soon
1858,,,,,,,"@turadg an .ipa file is what you upload to apple, did you have problems with it?"
1859,,,,,,,@ben standalone app pipeline is updated to sdk17 also?
1860,,,,,,,dunno
1861,,,,,,,@singhalok641 uploaded a file: index.jpeg
1862,,,,,,,It appears there's some kind of issue with your launch image
1863,,,,,,,Pretty cool: https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/ just saying
1864,,,,,,,do you have both devices open?
1865,,,,,,,"I'm testing out facebookAds and expo client crashes whenever the bannerView is clicked. Also based on the documentation, what is the function to be used when the call to action is pressed for native ads?"
1866,,,,,,,literally the normal way of using MapKit at this point is to apply a bunch of hacks to reduce memory usage
1867,,,,,,,Have you seen this?
1868,,,,,,,"thanks for sharing. there is another rn pkg that is working encoding the files to aac, so ill just stick with that. i was trying to consolidate dependencies and use expo everywhere i could, but i guess the expo audio api isnt creating a session? c'est la vie. thanks again"
1869,,,,,,,Awesome! Good to hear!
1870,,,,,,,"Just watched the F8 keynote.., /gif mindblown"
1871,,,,,,,If you want you can get access to my repo or my expo build
1872,,,,,,,"hey, is there a way on Expo to upload our own push certificate / keys, so that Expo push can be supported on ejected apps? This would be handy because detaching currently means having to rewrite the whole push infrastructure of an existing Expo app, and migrating from Expo to OneSignal or manual push is not as straightforward as it can seems"
1873,,,,,,,I understand that. But for example on iOS it properly resolves relative path to bundle.
1874,,,,,,,Hello everyone! I would like to connect SQLite when i'm on Expo Client on Android - development mode?
1875,,,,,,,It will be fixed in SDK 23

1878,,,,,,,"expo: 15.0.0,"
1879,,,,,,,"I already a little bit the code, but getNavigator is attached to the context ... I don't know yet how to get it in another way..."
1880,,,,,,,"@brent Got it, thanks! I'm curious, was there any performance reason not to include it by default?"
1881,,,,,,,@dehli @satya164 you worked on the ads stuff right?
1882,,,,,,,Ok thats good to know. Is there a way to disable OTA updates? It seems like the only way to do that is to change the app's slug.
1883,,,,,,,hello! looking at that
1884,,,,,,,Hmm. It seems my app doesn't get new OTA updates. I didn't changed sdk version or any of those restricted properties. How I can debug it?
1885,,,,,,,I actually just had a user uninstall and re-install expo and he's still getting an old version of my code...so strange
1886,,,,,,,"ngrok - install failed { Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/usr/lib/node_modules/ngrok/bin/ngrok'"
1887,,,,,,,Is there any alternative to expo that can use to serve reactnative in easy way

1893,,,,,,,"thanks, we're pushing a fix for that soon, should be live in an hour or so, sorry for the hassle. if you appeal and apple rejects, you'll need to rebuild. or if you wait a bit, i'll ping you when the fix has been applied and you can rebuild/resubmit"
1894,,,,,,,you don't need to compare props
1895,,,,,,,@keith uploaded a file: Code for scaling down image taken with the camera and commented: @simon_rsp here you go!

1903,,,,,,,are you on pc or mac?
1904,,,,,,,this seems obvious but cant find an answer in the forums. failing to load LAN url even tho simulator and phone is on the same network as host. anyone encounter this? visiting 192.168.0.38:19000 from mobile browser returns expo JSON
1905,,,,,,,@ccheever I figured it out
1906,,,,,,,"I am having the worse time working with Picker, specifically styling it to stay at the bottom of the screen. Anyone using the Picker and have any solutions or packages that is better?"
1907,,,,,,,"expo's asset layer currently always uploads your assets to s3 when you publish, then replaces the JS asset requires with the s3 hash, so I'm not sure there's much you can do to convince it to bundle your assets"
1908,,,,,,,Hello folks -- has anyone successfully targeted a specific iOS version for a standalone app with this trick in app.json?
1909,,,,,,,the problem is that react-native-cli generates a project where the status bar is opaque and so everyone builds their libraries assuming that this will always be the case on android
1910,,,,,,,Thanks peter!
1911,,,,,,,you are right - its react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view@0.4.1causing it
1912,,,,,,,Let me look for more settings around. The Whatsapp or Messenger notifications sound fine tho

1919,,,,,,,lol np
1920,,,,,,,Yes. Thanks a lot for help! It makes sense to me. So you are suggesting me to fork react-native-pull-to-refresh and fix PropTypes injection problem myself?
1921,,,,,,,"ok great, what did you do to solve it?"
1922,,,,,,,"Hi I'm new to Exponent , Can any one help me understanding how to wire Fbauth , Twitter auth to exponent ?"

1950,,,,,,,"If you want to see if it's the cause of an issue you could just include react@16 but, as Peter has just said, because of the fact that it's React 16, you'll likely get those issues anyway."
1951,,,,,,,"@trungtrungkang you can never rollback once you've upgraded, this is not so great on our end and we're working to fix that. so thats why you see the exception."
1952,,,,,,,"Hi there!  just wondering - as I was developing with RN, I have a function (let's call it foo) that returns an Image (fetches from some uri) in the render() function. When I was console.logging, I accidentally found out that the method foo is being called several times. I'm also using Expo.Audio that has onPlaybackStatusUpdate to update the state of the audio object. foo uses one of the audio's states. What is the best way to handle this? I'm worried it'll use up a lot of unnecessary data/will cause performance issue."
1953,,,,,,,"oh, splendid, thanks again !"
1954,,,,,,,"okay, I'll try that. I got the installation code from https://github.com/expo/React-Native-Elements"
